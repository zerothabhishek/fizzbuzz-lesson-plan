## ARGV

ARGV is an array that holds the arguments passed while the ruby program is invoked from command line.

Example: sample.rb

    puts ARGV

Execute:

    ruby sample.rb hello 12
    #prints hello 12

The program name and `ruby` are not counted


## Reading files

Read as a big string

    str = File.read("sample")


Read as lines
(most useful)

    lines = File.readlines("sample")  # lines = array of lines, separated by \n
    lines.each do |line|
      ## My code
    end


Open the file and read line by line:
(use when files are big)

    File.open("sample", "r") do |f|
      f.each_line do |line|
        ## My code
      end
    end


## ARGF

ARGF is the file descriptor of the standard input.
To read from standard input, we can use:

    ARGF.read

This will block the program until STDIN comes up with something
